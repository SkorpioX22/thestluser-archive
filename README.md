# thestluser-archive
A collection of my 3D projects made in FreeCAD 0.21 (previously) and 1.0+ (currently)

Reminder: Some of these files may be unpublished files. Therefore, they may be unfinished and not work as intended. Requests for 3D projects to be finished may be sent in Issues.

Working, final models can be found on Thingiverse and MakerWorld. See my profiles here: https://notnt.carrd.co
